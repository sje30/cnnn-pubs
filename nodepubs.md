# UK Neuroinformatics publications

This page lists some recent publications in
[Computational Neuroscience and Neuroinformatics by UK researchers](http://neuroinformatics.org.uk).
It is not meant to be exhaustive but shows the breadth of
neuroinformatics work performed in the UK.

If you are part of the UK neuroinformatics community and wish to add a
publication to the list, just email Stephen Eglen the DOI and/or
pubmed reference.  Please do not send more than one or two papers so
that we maintain a diversity of publications from different research
groups.
