  abstract    = "The synaptic connectivity within neuronal networks is thought
                 to determine the information processing they perform, yet
                 network structure-function relationships remain poorly
                 understood. By combining quantitative anatomy of the
                 cerebellar input layer and information theoretic analysis of
                 network models, we investigated how synaptic connectivity
                 affects information transmission and processing. Simplified
                 binary models revealed that the synaptic connectivity within
                 feedforward networks determines the trade-off between
                 information transmission and sparse encoding. Networks with
                 few synaptic connections per neuron and
                 network-activity-dependent threshold were optimal for lossless
                 sparse encoding over the widest range of input activities.
                 Biologically detailed spiking network models with
                 experimentally constrained synaptic conductances and
                 inhibition confirmed our analytical predictions. Our results
                 establish that the synaptic connectivity within the cerebellar
                 input layer enables efficient lossless sparse encoding.
                 Moreover, they provide a functional explanation for why

                 exact role of immune cells remains elusive. Thus, in the
                 present study we investigated whether lymphocytes are
                 protective/detrimental in in vitro models of excitotoxicty.
                 Kainate (KA)-induced neuronal death was significantly reduced
                 following exposure to mixed lymphocytes or purified T
                 lymphocytes containing either activated or non-activated
                 T-lymphocytes. Conditioned media from lymphocyte preparations,
                 but not boiled conditioned media, was protective against
                 KA-induced toxicity indicating soluble mediators underlie the
                 observed neuroprotection with cytokine arrays indicating IL-16
                 as the likely candidate. A role for astrocytes was established
                 as the neuroprotection was abolished in the presence of the
                 glial toxin, fluoroacetate. Furthermore, lymphocytes inhibited
                 p38 MAPK and ERK signalling pathways with pharmacological
                 inhibition of these pathways mimicking the protective effect
                 of lymphocytes. Similarly, lymphocytes were neuroprotective
                 against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell death
                 with the inhibition of p38 MAPK and ERK signalling pathways
                 involved. These data indicate that lymphocytes are
                 neuroprotective under our experimental conditions and we
                 suggest that astrocytic activation and inhibition of MAPK
                 signalling cascades are involved but further studies are

                 We report here findings that extend existing knowledge and
                 show that a modified reinforcement learning model, which has
                 separate parameters according to whether the previous trial
                 gave a reward or a punishment, can provide the best fit to
                 human behavior in decision making under uncertainty. More
                 specifically, we examined the fit of our modified
                 reinforcement learning model to human behavioral data in a
                 probabilistic two-alternative decision making task with rule
                 reversals. Our results demonstrate that this model predicted
                 human behavior better than a series of other models based on
                 reinforcement learning or Bayesian reasoning. Unlike the
                 Bayesian models, our modified reinforcement learning model

                 as many rewards as possible without trying to describe human
                 behavior, the performance of modified reinforcement learning
                 and Bayesian methods is similar. Others have used various
                 computational models to describe human behavior in similar
                 tasks, however, we are not aware of any who have compared

                 asynchronous synaptic input arising from ongoing network
                 activity. However, little is known about how such 'background'
                 synaptic input interacts with nonlinear dendritic mechanisms.
                 We have modified an existing model of a layer 5 (L5) pyramidal
                 cell to explore how dendritic integration in the apical
                 dendritic tuft could be altered by the levels of network
                 activity observed in vivo. Here we show that asynchronous
                 background excitatory input increases neuronal gain and
                 extends both temporal and spatial integration of
                 stimulus-evoked synaptic input onto the dendritic tuft.
                 Addition of fast and slow inhibitory synaptic conductances,
                 with properties similar to those from dendritic targeting
                 interneurons, that provided a 'balanced' background
                 configuration, partially counteracted these effects,
                 suggesting that inhibition can tune spatio-temporal
                 integration in the tuft. Excitatory background input lowered
                 the threshold for NMDA receptor-mediated dendritic spikes,
                 extended their duration and increased the probability of
                 additional regenerative events occurring in neighbouring
                 branches. These effects were also observed in a passive model
                 where all the non-synaptic voltage-gated conductances were

              which highly resembles physiologically measured response of the
              mammalian cochlea. The filter consists of three specialized
              sub-filter stages which respectively provide passive response in
              low frequencies, actively tunable response in mid-band
              frequencies and ultra-steep roll-off at transition frequencies
              from pass-band to stop-band. The sub-filters are implemented in
              balanced ladder topology using floating active inductors.
              Measured results from the fabricated chip show that wide range of
              mid-band tuning including gain tuning of over 20dB, Q factor
              tuning from 2 to 19 as well as the bio-realistic center frequency
              shift are achieved by adjusting only one circuit parameter.
              Besides, the filter has an ultra-steep roll-off reaching over 300
              dB/dec. By changing biasing currents, the filter can be
              configured to operate with center frequencies from 31 Hz to 8

                 cortical connectivity have been discovered: small-world
                 structure, pronounced hierarchical and modular organisation,
                 and strong core and rich-club structures. A common assumption
                 when interpreting results of this kind is that the observed
                 structural properties are present to enable the brain's
                 function. However, the brain is also embedded into the limited
                 space of the skull and its wiring has associated developmental
                 and metabolic costs. These basic physical and economic aspects
                 place separate, often conflicting, constraints on the brain's
                 connectivity, which must be characterized in order to
                 understand the true relationship between brain structure and
                 function. To address this challenge, here we ask which, and to
                 what extent, aspects of the structural organisation of the
                 brain are conserved if we preserve specific spatial and
                 topological properties of the brain but otherwise randomise
                 its connectivity. We perform a comparative analysis of a
                 connectivity map of the cortical connectome both on high- and
                 low-resolutions utilising three different types of surrogate
                 networks: spatially unconstrained ('random'), connection
                 length preserving ('spatial'), and connection length optimised
                 ('reduced') surrogates. We find that unconstrained
                 randomisation markedly diminishes all investigated
                 architectural properties of cortical connectivity. By
                 contrast, spatial and reduced surrogates largely preserve most
                 properties and, interestingly, often more so in the reduced
                 surrogates. Specifically, our results suggest that the
                 cortical network is less tightly integrated than its spatial
                 constraints would allow, but more strongly segregated than its
                 spatial constraints would necessitate. We additionally find
                 that hierarchical organisation and rich-club structure of the
                 cortical connectivity are largely preserved in spatial and
                 reduced surrogates and hence may be partially attributable to
                 cortical wiring constraints. In contrast, the high modularity
                 and strong s-core of the high-resolution cortical network are
                 significantly stronger than in the surrogates, underlining
                 their potential functional relevance in the brain.",

                 sources in multi-odour backgrounds. Recent behavioural
                 experiments show that this ability relies on detecting
                 millisecond stimulus asynchronies between odourants that
                 originate from different sources. Honeybees, Apis mellifera,
                 are able to distinguish mixtures where both odourants arrive
                 at the same time (synchronous mixtures) from those where
                 odourant onsets are staggered (asynchronous mixtures) down to
                 an onset delay of only 6ms. In this paper we explore this
                 surprising ability in a model of the insects' primary
                 olfactory brain area, the antennal lobe. We hypothesize that a
                 winner-take-all inhibitory network of local neurons in the
                 antennal lobe has a symmetry-breaking effect, such that the
                 response pattern in projection neurons to an asynchronous
                 mixture is different from the response pattern to the
                 corresponding synchronous mixture for an extended period of
                 time beyond the initial odourant onset where the two mixture
                 conditions actually differ. The prolonged difference between
                 response patterns to synchronous and asynchronous mixtures
                 could facilitate odoursegregation in downstream circuits of
                 the olfactory pathway. We present a detailed data-driven model

                 experimentally observed physiological odour responses,
                 successfully implements the hypothesised symmetry-breaking
                 mechanism and so demonstrates that this mechanism is

                 afferents to filtered, white noise whisker motion in
                 anesthetized rats. The model accurately predicted not only the

                 limited period of development before the onset of visual
                 experience. The spatiotemporal patterns encoded in the waves
                 are believed to be instructive for the wiring of functional
                 connections throughout the visual system. However, the
                 ontogeny of retinal waves is still poorly documented as a
                 result of the relatively low resolution of conventional
                 recording techniques. Here, we characterize the spatiotemporal
                 features of mouse retinal waves from birth until eye opening
                 in unprecedented detail using a large-scale, dense,
                 4096-channel multielectrode array that allowed us to record
                 from the entire neonatal retina at near cellular resolution.
                 We found that early cholinergic waves propagate with random
                 trajectories over large areas with low ganglion cell
                 recruitment. They become slower, smaller and denser when GABAA
                 signalling matures, as occurs beyond postnatal day (P) 7.
                 Glutamatergic influences dominate from P10, coinciding with
                 profound changes in activity dynamics. At this time, waves
                 cease to be random and begin to show repetitive trajectories
                 confined to a few localized hotspots. These hotspots gradually
                 tile the retina with time, and disappear after eye opening.
                 Our observations demonstrate that retinal waves undergo major
                 spatiotemporal changes during ontogeny. Our results support
                 the hypotheses that cholinergic waves guide the refinement of
                 retinal targets and that glutamatergic waves may also support
                 the wiring of retinal receptive fields.",

                 agents, yet at first sight this appears to be their only
                 commonality. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic agent,
                 whose main mechanism of action is considered to be
                 N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism; whereas propofol is a
                 general anesthetic agent, which is assumed to primarily
                 potentiate currents gated by γ-aminobutyric acid type A
                 (GABAA) receptors. However, several experimental observations
                 suggest a closer relationship. First, the effect of ketamine
                 on the electroencephalogram (EEG) is markedly changed in the
                 presence of propofol: on its own ketamine increases θ (4-8 Hz)
                 and decreases α (8-13 Hz) oscillations, whereas ketamine
                 induces a significant shift to beta band frequencies (13-30
                 Hz) in the presence of propofol. Second, both ketamine and
                 propofol cause inhibition of the inward pacemaker current I h,
                 by binding to the corresponding hyperpolarization-activated
                 cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 1 (HCN1) subunit.
                 The resulting effect is a hyperpolarization of the neuron's
                 resting membrane potential. Third, the ability of both
                 ketamine and propofol to induce hypnosis is reduced in
                 HCN1-knockout mice. Here we show that one can theoretically
                 understand the observed spectral changes of the EEG based on
                 HCN1-mediated hyperpolarizations alone, without involving the
                 supposed main mechanisms of action of these drugs through NMDA
                 and GABAA, respectively. On the basis of our successful EEG
                 model we conclude that ketamine and propofol should be
                 antagonistic to each other in their interaction at HCN1
                 subunits. Such a prediction is in accord with the results of
                 clinical experiment in which it is found that ketamine and
                 propofol interact in an infra-additive manner with respect to
                 the endpoints of hypnosis and immobility.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:During early development, neural circuits fire
              spontaneously, generating activity episodes with complex
              spatiotemporal patterns. Recordings of spontaneous activity have
              been made in many parts of the nervous system over the last 25
              years, reporting developmental changes in activity patterns and
              the effects of various genetic perturbations.RESULTS:We present a
              curated repository of multielectrode array recordings of
              spontaneous activity in developing mouse and ferret retina. The
              data have been annotated with minimal metadata and converted into
              HDF5. This paper describes the structure of the data, along with
              examples of reproducible research using these data files. We also
              demonstrate how these data can be analysed in the CARMEN workflow
              system. This article is written as a literate programming
              document; all programs and data described here are freely
              available.CONCLUSIONS:1. We hope this repository will lead to
              novel analysis of spontaneous activity recorded in different
              laboratories. 2. We encourage published data to be added to the
              repository. 3. This repository serves as an example of how
              multielectrode array recordings can be stored for long-term
              reuse.",

                 assessment of the topographic order within the pattern of
                 connections between two structures. We apply this method to
                 published visuocollicular mapping data obtained by
                 Fourier-based intrinsic imaging of mouse colliculus. We find
                 that, in maps from wild types and β2 knock-outs, at least 150
                 points on the colliculus are represented in the visual field
                 in the correct relative order. In maps from animals with
                 knock-out of the three ephrinA ligands (TKO), thought to
                 specify the rostrocaudal axis of the map, the projection on
                 the colliculus of each small circular area of visual field is
                 elongated approximately rostrocaudally. Of these projections,
                 9\% are made up of two distinct regions lying along the
                 direction of ingrowth of retinal fibers. These are similar to
                 the ectopic projections found in other ephrinA knock-out data.
                 Coexisting with the ectopic projections, each TKO map contains
                 a submap where neighbor-neighbor relations are preserved,
                 which is ordered along both rostrocaudal and mediolateral
                 axes, in the orientation found in wild-type maps. The submaps
                 vary in size with order well above chance level, which can
                 approach the order in wild-type maps. Knock-out of both β2 and
                 two of the three ephrinAs yields maps with some order. The
                 ordered TKO maps cannot be produced by correlated neural
                 activity acting alone, as this mechanism is unable to specify
                 map orientation. These results invite reassessment of the role
                 of molecular signaling, particularly that of ephrinAs, in the
                 formation of ordered nerve connections.",

  abstract    = "The concept of topographic mapping is central to the
                 understanding of the visual system at many levels, from the
                 developmental to the computational. It is important to be able
                 to relate different coordinate systems, e.g. maps of the
                 visual field and maps of the retina. Retinal maps are
                 frequently based on flat-mount preparations. These use
                 dissection and relaxing cuts to render the quasi-spherical
                 retina into a 2D preparation. The variable nature of relaxing
                 cuts and associated tears limits quantitative cross-animal
                 comparisons. We present an algorithm, {"}Retistruct,{"} that
                 reconstructs retinal flat-mounts by mapping them into a
                 standard, spherical retinal space. This is achieved by:
                 stitching the marked-up cuts of the flat-mount outline;
                 dividing the stitched outline into a mesh whose vertices then
                 are mapped onto a curtailed sphere; and finally moving the
                 vertices so as to minimise a physically-inspired deformation
                 energy function. Our validation studies indicate that the
                 algorithm can estimate the position of a point on the intact
                 adult retina to within 8° of arc (3.6\% of nasotemporal axis).
                 The coordinates in reconstructed retinae can be transformed to
                 visuotopic coordinates. Retistruct is used to investigate the
                 organisation of the adult mouse visual system. We orient the
                 retina relative to the nictitating membrane and compare this
                 to eye muscle insertions. To align the retinotopic and
                 visuotopic coordinate systems in the mouse, we utilised the
                 geometry of binocular vision. In standard retinal space, the
                 composite decussation line for the uncrossed retinal
                 projection is located 64° away from the retinal pole.
                 Projecting anatomically defined uncrossed retinal projections
                 into visual space gives binocular congruence if the optical
                 axis of the mouse eye is oriented at 64° azimuth and 22°
                 elevation, in concordance with previous results. Moreover,
                 using these coordinates, the dorsoventral boundary for S-opsin
                 expressing cones closely matches the horizontal meridian.",
