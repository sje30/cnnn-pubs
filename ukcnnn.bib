  abstract    = "In many species, rapid defensive reflexes are paramount to
                 escaping acute danger. These reflexes are modulated by the
                 state of the environment. This is exemplified in
                 fear-potentiated startle, a more vigorous startle response
                 during conditioned anticipation of an unrelated threatening
                 event. Extant explanations of this phenomenon build on
                 descriptive models of underlying psychological states, or
                 neural processes. Yet, they fail to predict invigorated
                 startle during reward anticipation and instructed attention,
                 and do not explain why startle reflex modulation evolved.
                 Here, we fill this lacuna by developing a normative cost
                 minimisation model based on Bayesian optimality principles.
                 This model predicts the observed pattern of startle
                 modification by rewards, punishments, instructed attention,
                 and several other states. Moreover, the mathematical formalism
                 furnishes predictions that can be tested experimentally.
                 Comparing the model with existing data suggests a specific
                 neural implementation of the underlying computations which
                 yields close approximations to the optimal solution under most
                 circumstances. This analysis puts startle modification into
                 the framework of Bayesian decision theory and predictive
                 coding, and illustrates the importance of an adaptive
                 perspective to interpret defensive behaviour across species.",

  abstract    = "Living organisms need to maintain energetic homeostasis. For
                 many species, this implies taking actions with delayed
                 consequences. For example, humans may have to decide between
                 foraging for high-calorie but hard-to-get, and low-calorie but
                 easy-to-get food, under threat of starvation. Homeostatic
                 principles prescribe decisions that maximize the probability
                 of sustaining appropriate energy levels across the entire
                 foraging trajectory. Here, predictions from biological
                 principles contrast with predictions from economic
                 decision-making models based on maximizing the utility of the
                 endpoint outcome of a choice. To empirically arbitrate between
                 the predictions of biological and economic models for
                 individual human decision-making, we devised a virtual
                 foraging task in which players chose repeatedly between two
                 foraging environments, lost energy by the passage of time, and
                 gained energy probabilistically according to the statistics of
                 the environment they chose. Reaching zero energy was framed as
                 starvation. We used the mathematics of random walks to derive
                 endpoint outcome distributions of the choices. This also
                 furnished equivalent lotteries, presented in a purely
                 economic, casino-like frame, in which starvation corresponded
                 to winning nothing. Bayesian model comparison showed that--in
                 both the foraging and the casino frames--participants' choices
                 depended jointly on the probability of starvation and the
                 expected endpoint value of the outcome, but could not be
                 explained by economic models based on combinations of
                 statistical moments or on rank-dependent utility. This implies
                 that under precisely defined constraints biological principles
                 are better suited to explain human decision-making than
                 economic models based on endpoint utility maximization.",

                 parametric, typically relying on autoregressive models. A

                 currents contribute to the coding efficiency and energy
                 efficiency of cortical neurons remains unclear. We used single
                 compartment computational models with stochastic voltage-gated
                 ion channels to determine whether synaptic regimes that
                 produce balanced excitatory and inhibitory currents have
                 specific advantages over other input regimes. Specifically, we
                 compared models with only excitatory synaptic inputs to those
                 with equal excitatory and inhibitory conductances, and
                 stronger inhibitory than excitatory conductances (i.e.
                 approximately balanced synaptic currents). Using these models,
                 we show that balanced synaptic currents evoke fewer spikes per
                 second than excitatory inputs alone or equal excitatory and
                 inhibitory conductances. However, spikes evoked by balanced
                 synaptic inputs are more informative (bits/spike), so that
                 spike trains evoked by all three regimes have similar
                 information rates (bits/s). Consequently, because spikes
                 dominate the energy consumption of our computational models,
                 approximately balanced synaptic currents are also more energy
                 efficient than other synaptic regimes. Thus, by producing
                 fewer, more informative spikes approximately balanced synaptic
                 currents in cortical neurons can promote both coding
                 efficiency and energy efficiency.",

               their relationship to information coding is critical to
               understanding neuronal function and evolution. Three of the main
               determinants are cell size, ion channel density, and stimulus
               statistics. Here we investigate their impact on neuronal energy
               consumption and information coding by comparing
               single-compartment spiking neuron models of different sizes with
               different densities of stochastic voltage-gated Na+ and K+
               channels and different statistics of synaptic inputs. The
               largest compartments have the highest information rates but the
               lowest energy efficiency for a given voltage-gated ion channel
               density, and the highest signaling efficiency (bits spike−1) for
               a given firing rate. For a given cell size, our models revealed
               that the ion channel density that maximizes energy efficiency is
               lower than that maximizing information rate. Low rates of small
               synaptic inputs improve energy efficiency but the highest
               information rates occur with higher rates and larger inputs.
               These relationships produce a Law of Diminishing Returns that
               penalizes costly excess information coding capacity, promoting
               the reduction of cell size, channel density, and input stimuli
               to the minimum possible, suggesting that the trade-off between
               energy and information has influenced all aspects of neuronal

                 and action potentials, converting between them within single
                 neurons and successive processing layers. This conversion is
                 accompanied by information loss and a drop in energy
                 efficiency. We investigate the biophysical causes of this loss
                 of information and efficiency by comparing spiking neuron
                 models, containing stochastic voltage-gated Na(+) and K(+)
                 channels, with generator potential and graded potential models
                 lacking voltage-gated Na(+) channels. We identify three causes
                 of information loss in the generator potential that are the
                 by-product of action potential generation: (1) the
                 voltage-gated Na(+) channels necessary for action potential
                 generation increase intrinsic noise and (2) introduce
                 non-linearities, and (3) the finite duration of the action
                 potential creates a 'footprint' in the generator potential
                 that obscures incoming signals. These three processes reduce
                 information rates by ∼50\% in generator potentials, to ∼3
                 times that of spike trains. Both generator potentials and
                 graded potentials consume almost an order of magnitude less
                 energy per second than spike trains. Because of the lower
                 information rates of generator potentials they are
                 substantially less energy efficient than graded potentials.
                 However, both are an order of magnitude more efficient than
                 spike trains due to the higher energy costs and low
                 information content of spikes, emphasizing that there is a

                 and clinical data to detect putative genes for complexly
                 inherited neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.
                 Several major big-data challenges arise from testing
                 genome-wide (NC>12 million known variants) associations with
                 signals at millions of locations (NV~10(6)) in the brain from
                 thousands of subjects (n~10(3)). The aim of this paper is to
                 develop a Fast Voxelwise Genome Wide Association analysiS
                 (FVGWAS) framework to efficiently carry out whole-genome
                 analyses of whole-brain data. FVGWAS consists of three
                 components including a heteroscedastic linear model, a global
                 sure independence screening (GSIS) procedure, and a detection
                 procedure based on wild bootstrap methods. Specifically, for
                 standard linear association, the computational complexity is O
                 (nNVNC) for voxelwise genome wide association analysis (VGWAS)
                 method compared with O ((NC+NV)n(2)) for FVGWAS. Simulation
                 studies show that FVGWAS is an efficient method of searching
                 sparse signals in an extremely large search space, while
                 controlling for the family-wise error rate. Finally, we have
                 successfully applied FVGWAS to a large-scale imaging genetic
                 data analysis of ADNI data with 708 subjects, 193,275voxels in
                 RAVENS maps, and 501,584 SNPs, and the total processing time
                 was 203,645s for a single CPU. Our FVGWAS may be a valuable
                 statistical toolbox for large-scale imaging genetic analysis

                 abnormal behaviour and disease. To investigate how common
                 genetic variants affect the structure of these brain regions,
                 here we conduct genome-wide association studies of the volumes
                 of seven subcortical regions and the intracranial volume
                 derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals
                 from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants
                 influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We
                 also find stronger evidence for three loci with previously
                 established influences on hippocampal volume and intracranial
                 volume. These variants show specific volumetric effects on
                 brain structures rather than global effects across structures.
                 The strongest effects were found for the putamen, where a

                 putamen volume clustered near developmental genes that

  abstract = "Cellular activity in the CA1 area of the hippocampus waxes and
              wanes at theta frequency (4--8 Hz) during exploratory behavior of
              rats. Perisomatic inhibition onto pyramidal cells tends to be
              strongest out of phase with pyramidal cell activity, whereas
              dendritic inhibition is strongest in phase with pyramidal cell
              activity. Synaptic plasticity also varies across the theta cycle,
              from strong long-term potentiation (LTP) to long-term depression
              (LTD), putatively corresponding to encoding and retrieval phases
              for information patterns encoded by pyramidal cell activity
              (Hasselmo et al. (2002a) Neural Comput 14:793--817). The
              mechanisms underpinning the phasic changes in plasticity are not
              clear, but it is likely that inhibition plays a role by affecting
              levels of electrical activity and calcium concentration at
              synapses. We explore the properties of synaptic plasticity during
              theta at Schaffer collateral synapses on CA1 pyramidal neurons
              and the influence of spatially and temporally targeted inhibition
              using a detailed multicompartmental model of the CA1 pyramidal
              neuron microcircuit and a phenomenological model of synaptic
              plasticity. The results suggest CA3-CA1 synapses are potentiated
              on one phase of theta due to high calcium levels provided by
              paired weak CA3 and layer III entorhinal cortex (EC) inputs even
              when somatic spiking is inhibited by perisomatic interneuron
              activity. Weak CA3 inputs alone induce lower calcium transients
              and result in depression of the CA3-CA1 synapses. These synapses
              are depressed if activated in phase with dendritic inhibition as
              strong CA3 inputs alone are not able to cause high calcium in
              this theta phase even though the CA1 pyramidal neuron shows
              somatic spiking. Dendritic inhibition acts as a switch that
              prevents LTP and promotes LTD during the retrieval phases of the
              theta rhythm in CA1 pyramidal cell. This may be important for not
              overly reinforcing recalled memories and in forgetting no longer
              relevant memories. \copyright{} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

                 map of connections. The details of mechanisms involved, and
                 the degree to which they might interact, are still not well
                 understood. We have developed a framework within which
                 existing computational models can be assessed in an unbiased

                 curated from the mouse retinocollicular system. Our framework
                 facilitates comparison between models, testing new models
                 against known phenotypes and simulating new phenotypes in
                 existing models. We have used this framework to assess four
                 representative models that combine Eph/ephrin gradients and/or
                 activity-based mechanisms and competition. Two of the models
                 were updated from their original form to fit into our
                 framework. The models were tested against five different
                 phenotypes: wild type, Isl2-EphA3(ki/ki) , Isl2-EphA3(ki/+) ,
                 ephrin-A2,A3,A5 triple knock-out (TKO), and Math5(-/-)
                 (Atoh7). Two models successfully reproduced the extent of the
                 Math5(-/-) anteromedial projection, but only one of those
                 could account for the collapse point in Isl2-EphA3(ki/+) . The
                 models needed a weak anteroposterior gradient in the SC to
                 reproduce the residual order in the ephrin-A2,A3,A5 TKO

              spatiotemporal firing patterns during development. This
              spontaneous activity is thought to help guide development of the
              nervous system. In this study, we had two aims. First, to
              characterise the changes in spontaneous activity in cultures of
              developing networks of either hippocampal or cortical neurons
              dissociated from mouse. Second, to assess whether there are any
              functional differences in the patterns of activity in hippocampal
              and cortical networks.ResultsWe used multielectrode arrays to
              record the development of spontaneous activity in cultured
              networks of either hippocampal or cortical neurons every 2 or 3
              days for the first month after plating. Within a few days of
              culturing, networks exhibited spontaneous activity. This activity
              strengthened and then stabilised typically around 21 days in
              vitro. We quantified the activity patterns in hippocampal and
              cortical networks using 11 features. Three out of 11 features
              showed striking differences in activity between hippocampal and
              cortical networks: (1) interburst intervals are less variable in
              spike trains from hippocampal cultures; (2) hippocampal networks
              have higher correlations and (3) hippocampal networks generate
              more robust theta-bursting patterns. Machine-learning techniques
              confirmed that these differences in patterning are sufficient to
              classify recordings reliably at any given age as either
              hippocampal or cortical networks.ConclusionsAlthough cultured
              networks of hippocampal and cortical networks both generate
              spontaneous activity that changes over time, at any given time we
              can reliably detect differences in the activity patterns. We
              anticipate that this quantitative framework could have
              applications in many areas, including neurotoxicity testing and
              for characterising the phenotype of different mutant mice. All

                 also form an elite, densely connected 'club'. In brain
                 networks, rich clubs incur high physical connection costs but
                 also appear to be especially valuable to brain function.
                 However, little is known about the selection pressures that
                 drive their formation. Here, we take two complementary
                 approaches to this question: firstly we show, using generative
                 modelling, that the emergence of rich clubs in large-scale
                 human brain networks can be driven by an economic trade-off
                 between connection costs and a second, competing topological
                 term. Secondly we show, using simulated neural networks, that
                 Hebbian learning rules also drive the emergence of rich clubs
                 at the microscopic level, and that the prominence of these
                 features increases with learning time. These results suggest
                 that Hebbian learning may provide a neuronal mechanism for the
                 selection of complex features such as rich clubs. The neural
                 networks that we investigate are explicitly Hebbian, and we
                 argue that the topological term in our model of large-scale
                 brain connectivity may represent an analogous connection rule.
                 This putative link between learning and rich clubs is also
                 consistent with predictions that integrative aspects of brain
                 network organization are especially important for adaptive

                 networks as complex systems, with researchers often using
                 neuroimaging to represent the large-scale organization of
                 nervous systems without precise cellular resolution. Here we
                 used graph theory to investigate the neuronal connectome of
                 the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which is defined
                 anatomically at a cellular scale as 2287 synaptic connections
                 between 279 neurons. We identified a small number of highly
                 connected neurons as a rich club (N = 11) interconnected with
                 high efficiency and high connection distance. Rich club
                 neurons comprise almost exclusively the interneurons of the
                 locomotor circuits, with known functional importance for
                 coordinated movement. The rich club neurons are connector
                 hubs, with high betweenness centrality, and many intermodular
                 connections to nodes in different modules. On identifying the
                 shortest topological paths (motifs) between pairs of
                 peripheral neurons, the motifs that are found most frequently
                 traverse the rich club. The rich club neurons are born early
                 in development, before visible movement of the animal and
                 before the main phase of developmental elongation of its body.
                 We conclude that the high wiring cost of the globally
                 integrative rich club of neurons in the C. elegans connectome
                 is justified by the adaptive value of coordinated movement of
                 the animal. The economical trade-off between physical cost and
                 behavioral value of rich club organization in a cellular
                 connectome confirms theoretical expectations and recapitulates
                 comparable results from human neuroimaging on much larger
                 scale networks, suggesting that this may be a general and

                 nontrivial topological patterns of connections combined with
                 nearly minimal wiring costs. However, the growth rules shaping
                 these economical tradeoffs between cost and topology are not
                 well understood. Here, we study the cellular nervous system of
                 the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, together with
                 information on the birth times of neurons and on their spatial
                 locations. We find that the growth of this network undergoes a
                 transition from an accelerated to a constant increase in the
                 number of links (synaptic connections) as a function of the
                 number of nodes (neurons). The time of this phase transition
                 coincides closely with the observed moment of hatching, when
                 development switches metamorphically from oval to larval
                 stages. We use graph analysis and generative modeling to show
                 that the transition between different growth regimes, as well
                 as its coincidence with the moment of hatching, may be
                 explained by a dynamic economical model that incorporates a
                 tradeoff between topology and cost that is continuously
                 negotiated and renegotiated over developmental time. As the
                 body of the animal progressively elongates, the cost of
                 longer-distance connections is increasingly penalized. This
                 growth process regenerates many aspects of the adult nervous
                 system's organization, including the neuronal membership of
                 anatomically predefined ganglia. We expect that similar
                 economical principles may be found in the development of other

                 cognition. However, the between session variance of many tasks

                 especially important in context of clinical applications. A
                 test-retest dataset was acquired to validate fMRI tasks used

                 analyses of fMRI data showed that the motor and language tasks
                 were reliable at the subject level while the landmark task was
                 not, despite all paradigms showing expected activations at the
                 group level. In addition, differences in reliability were
                 found to be mostly related to the tasks themselves while
                 task-by-motion interaction was the major confounding factor.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Together, this dataset provides a unique
                 opportunity to investigate the reliability of different fMRI
                 tasks, as well as methods and algorithms used to analyze,

                 (dMRI) and tractography have been demonstrated in healthy
                 volunteers and more recently in various disorders affecting
                 brain connectivity. However, few studies have addressed the
                 reproducibility of the resulting networks. We measured the
                 test-retest properties of such networks by varying several
                 factors affecting network construction using ten healthy
                 volunteers who underwent a dMRI protocol at 1.5T on two
                 separate occasions. Each T1-weighted brain was parcellated
                 into 84 regions-of-interest and network connections were
                 identified using dMRI and two alternative tractography
                 algorithms, two alternative seeding strategies, a white matter
                 waypoint constraint and three alternative network weightings.
                 In each case, four common graph-theoretic measures were
                 obtained. Network properties were assessed both node-wise and
                 per network in terms of the intraclass correlation coefficient
                 (ICC) and by comparing within- and between-subject
                 differences. Our findings suggest that test-retest performance
                 was improved when: 1) seeding from white matter, rather than
                 grey; and 2) using probabilistic tractography with a two-fibre
                 model and sufficient streamlines, rather than deterministic
                 tensor tractography. In terms of network weighting, a measure
                 of streamline density produced better test-retest performance
                 than tract-averaged diffusion anisotropy, although it remains
                 unclear which is a more accurate representation of the
                 underlying connectivity. For the best performing
                 configuration, the global within-subject differences were
                 between 3.2\% and 11.9\% with ICCs between 0.62 and 0.76. The
                 mean nodal within-subject differences were between 5.2\% and
                 24.2\% with mean ICCs between 0.46 and 0.62. For 83.3\%
                 (70/84) of nodes, the within-subject differences were smaller
                 than between-subject differences. Overall, these findings
                 suggest that whilst current techniques produce networks
                 capable of characterising the genuine between-subject
                 differences in connectivity, future work must be undertaken to
                 improve network reliability.",

                 explore the interface sitting at the border between
                 ophthalmology, neurology and computing science. It is from the
                 detail and depth of retinal phenotyping that novel metrics and

               spike-wave discharges (SWD) of absence seizures result from
               local activity within a hyperexcitable cortical region with
               rapid generalization through thalamocortical networks. The
               cortical focus is said to react more strongly to stimulation
               than other areas. We seek to develop a model which is in
               agreement with these recent experimental findings and suggest a
               possible explanation. In this study we extend an existing neural
               field model of thalamocortical interaction to account for
               multiple cortical regions which are connected according
               connectivity inferred from a clinically diagnosed epileptic
               patient. We stimulate at different model electrodes and
               investigate the resulting seizure duration. We observe that
               stimulation of only a small subset (11\%) of model electrodes
               can lead to the rapid generalisation of SWD via both
               corticocortical and thalamocortical pathways. We find that the
               resulting model dynamics (seizure duration) varies significantly
               dependent upon the nodes stimulated and the amplitude of the
               stimulus. Our model indicates that heterogeneities in
               corticocortical connectivity could serve as a possible reason
               for the cortical focus and provides a platform for in silico
               hypothesis generation in complement to in vivo hypothesis

  abstract    = "Active brain stimulation to abate epileptic seizures has shown
                 mixed success. In spike-wave (SW) seizures, where the seizure
                 and background state were proposed to coexist, single-pulse
                 stimulations have been suggested to be able to terminate the
                 seizure prematurely. However, several factors can impact
                 success in such a bistable setting. The factors contributing
                 to this have not been fully investigated on a theoretical and
                 mechanistic basis. Our aim is to elucidate mechanisms that
                 influence the success of single-pulse stimulation in
                 noise-induced SW seizures. In this work, we study a neural
                 population model of SW seizures that allows the reconstruction
                 of the basin of attraction of the background activity as a
                 four dimensional geometric object. For the deterministic
                 (noise-free) case, we show how the success of response to
                 stimuli depends on the amplitude and phase of the SW cycle, in
                 addition to the direction of the stimulus in state space. In
                 the case of spontaneous noise-induced seizures, the basin
                 becomes probabilistic introducing some degree of uncertainty
                 to the stimulation outcome while maintaining qualitative
                 features of the noise-free case. Additionally, due to the
                 different time scales involved in SW generation, there is
                 substantial variation between SW cycles, implying that there
                 may not be a fixed set of optimal stimulation parameters for
                 SW seizures. In contrast, the model suggests an adaptive
                 approach to find optimal stimulation parameters
                 patient-specifically, based on real-time estimation of the
                 position in state space. We discuss how the modelling work can
                 be exploited to rationally design a successful stimulation
                 protocol for the abatement of SW seizures using real-time SW
                 detection.",

              neurological disorders provide vital clues to understanding
              neural function. However, what determines whether the
              neurological damage is impairing or enhancing is unclear. Here we
              use the performance of patients with two disorders of the
              striatum to dissociate mechanisms underlying cognitive
              enhancement and impairment resulting from damage to the same
              system. In a two-choice decision task, Huntington's disease
              patients were faster and less error prone than controls, yet a
              patient with the rare condition of benign hereditary chorea (BHC)
              was both slower and more error prone. EEG recordings confirmed
              significant differences in neural processing between the groups.
              Analysis of a computational model revealed that the common loss
              of connectivity between striatal neurons in BHC and Huntington's
              disease impairs response selection, but the increased sensitivity
              of NMDA receptors in Huntington's disease potentially enhances
              response selection. Crucially the model shows that there is a
              critical threshold for increased sensitivity: below that
              threshold, impaired response selection results. Our data and
              model thus predict that specific striatal malfunctions can
              contribute to either impaired or enhanced selection, and provide
              clues to solving the paradox of how Huntington's disease can lead
              to both impaired and enhanced cognitive processes.",

               patch clamp in slices from juvenile (P14-P21) wild-type or
               PINK1-/- mice. We designed a horizontal tilted
               cortico-subthalamic slice where the only connection between
               cortex and subthalamic nucleus (STN) is the hyperdirect
               cortico-subthalamic pathway. We report excessive correlation and

                 (CS+) previously paired with electrical stimulation of the paw
                 but not to another stimulus presented alone (CS-). Similarly,
                 medial prefrontal cortex activity increases selectively during
                 CS+ presentation after discrimination learning but this occurs
                 only in neurons receiving input from the basolateral amygdala
                 (BLA), the main source of amygdaloid projections to this
                 region. However, BLA activity during discrimination learning
                 under anesthesia has not been investigated. Here we used in
                 vivo electrophysiology to examine BLA activity before and
                 after associative learning and during later memory retrieval
                 in anesthetized rats. We examined extracellular unit and local
                 field potential (LFP) activity using an auditory
                 discrimination learning paradigm. Rats were repeatedly
                 presented with two distinct sounds, one of which was paired
                 with electrical stimulation of the paw. One hour later, the
                 paired sound (CS+) was presented alone along with the sound
                 not paired with electrical stimulation (CS-). We found
                 increased unit firing late (1 h) but not early (5 min) after
                 learning. LFP power was increased both early and late after
                 learning. In control experiments we also found increased unit
                 and LFP activity late after electrical stimulation alone.
                 After discrimination learning, unit firing increased in
                 response to CS+, but not CS-, presentation. LFP power also
                 showed a modest increase during CS+, compared to CS-,
                 presentation. These findings suggest that discrimination
                 learning under anesthesia can occur at the neural level in
                 BLA. The potential relevance of these results is discussed in
                 relation to previous studies examining neural activity during
                 fear learning and memory processing in conscious animals.",

                 during presentation of an unpaired stimulus (CS-) in
                 anesthetized animals. Studies in conscious animals have shown
                 dissociable roles for different mPFC subregions in mediating
                 various memory processes, with the prelimbic (PL) and
                 infralimbic (IL) cortex involved in the retrieval and
                 extinction of conditioned responding, respectively. Therefore
                 PL and IL may also play different roles in mediating the
                 retrieval and extinction of discrimination learning under
                 anesthesia. Here we used in vivo electrophysiology to examine
                 unit and local field potential (LFP) activity in PL and IL
                 before and after auditory discrimination learning and during
                 later retrieval and extinction testing in anesthetized rats.
                 Animals received repeated presentations of two distinct
                 sounds, one of which was paired with footshock (US). In
                 separate control experiments animals received footshocks
                 without sounds. After discrimination learning the paired (CS+)
                 and unpaired (CS-) sounds were repeatedly presented alone. We
                 found increased unit firing and LFP power in PL and, to a
                 lesser extent, IL after discrimination learning but not after
                 footshocks alone. After discrimination learning, unit firing
                 and LFP power increased in PL and IL in response to
                 presentation of the first CS+, compared to the first CS-.
                 However, PL and IL activity increased during the last CS-
                 presentation, such that activity during presentation of the
                 last CS+ and CS- did not differ. These results confirm
                 previous findings and extend them by showing that increased PL
                 and IL activity result from encoding of the CS+/US association
                 rather than US presentation. They also suggest that extinction
                 may occur under anesthesia and might be represented at the

                 deficit in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been the focus of many
                 studies. Compensation mechanisms counteract synaptic loss and
                 prevent the catastrophic amnesia induced by synaptic loss via
                 maintaining the activity levels of neural circuits. Here we
                 investigate the interplay between various synaptic
                 degeneration and compensation mechanisms, and abnormal
                 cortical oscillations based on a large-scale network model
                 consisting of 100,000 neurons exhibiting several cortical
                 firing patterns, 8.5 million synapses, short-term plasticity,
                 axonal delays and receptor kinetics. The structure of the
                 model is inspired by the anatomy of the cerebral cortex. The
                 results of the modelling study suggest that cortical
                 oscillations respond differently to compensation mechanisms.
                 Local compensation preserves the baseline activity of theta
                 (5-7 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations whereas delta (1-4
                 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations are maintained via global
                 compensation. Applying compensation mechanisms independently
                 shows greater effects than combining both compensation
                 mechanisms in one model and applying them in parallel.
                 Consequently, it can be speculated that enhancing local
                 compensation might recover the neural processes and cognitive
                 functions that are associated with theta and alpha
                 oscillations whereas inducing global compensation might
                 contribute to the repair of neural (cognitive) processes which
                 are associated with delta and beta band activity. Compensation
                 mechanisms may vary across cortical regions and the activation
                 of inappropriate compensation mechanism in a particular region
                 may fail to recover network dynamics and/or induce secondary
                 pathological changes in the network.",

                 pressure, use an intrinsic mechanism to shift from slow
                 irregular firing to a distinct phasic pattern, consisting of
                 long bursts and silences lasting tens of seconds. With
                 increased input, bursts lengthen, eventually shifting to
                 continuous firing. The phasic activity remains asynchronous
                 across the cells and is not reflected in the population output
                 signal. Here we have used a computational vasopressin neuron
                 model to investigate the functional significance of the phasic
                 firing pattern. We generated a concise model of the synaptic
                 input driven spike firing mechanism that gives a close
                 quantitative match to vasopressin neuron spike activity
                 recorded in vivo, tested against endogenous activity and
                 experimental interventions. The integrate-and-fire based model
                 provides a simple physiological explanation of the phasic
                 firing mechanism involving an activity-dependent slow
                 depolarising afterpotential (DAP) generated by a
                 calcium-inactivated potassium leak current. This is modulated
                 by the slower, opposing, action of activity-dependent
                 dendritic dynorphin release, which inactivates the DAP, the
                 opposing effects generating successive periods of bursting and
                 silence. Model cells are not spontaneously active, but fire
                 when perturbed by random perturbations mimicking synaptic
                 input. We constructed one population of such phasic neurons,
                 and another population of similar cells but which lacked the
                 ability to fire phasically. We then studied how these two
                 populations differed in the way that they encoded changes in
                 afferent inputs. By comparison with the non-phasic population,
                 the phasic population responds linearly to increases in tonic
                 synaptic input. Non-phasic cells respond to transient
                 elevations in synaptic input in a way that strongly depends on
                 background activity levels, phasic cells in a way that is
                 independent of background levels, and show a similar strong
                 linearization of the response. These findings show large
                 differences in information coding between the populations, and

                 spike activity in response to elevated extracellular osmotic
                 pressure. These spikes are generated in the cell body and are
                 conducted down the axon to the axonal terminals where they
                 trigger Ca²⁺ entry and subsequent exocytosis of
                 hormone-containing vesicles and secretion of vasopressin. This
                 mechanism is highly non-linear, subject to both frequency
                 facilitation and fatigue, such that the rate of secretion
                 depends on both the rate and patterning of the spike activity.
                 Here we used computational modelling to investigate this
                 relationship and how it shapes the overall response of the
                 neuronal population. We generated a concise single compartment
                 model of the secretion mechanism, fitted to experimentally
                 observed profiles of facilitation and fatigue, and based on
                 representations of the hypothesised underlying mechanisms.
                 These mechanisms include spike broadening, Ca²⁺ channel
                 inactivation, a Ca²⁺ sensitive K⁺ current, and releasable and
                 reserve pools of vesicles. We coupled the secretion model to
                 an existing integrate-and-fire based spiking model in order to
                 study the secretion response to increasing synaptic input, and
                 compared phasic and non-phasic spiking models to assess the
                 functional value of the phasic spiking pattern. The secretory
                 response of individual phasic cells is very non-linear, but
                 the response of a heterogeneous population of phasic cells
                 shows a much more linear response to increasing input,
                 matching the linear response we observe experimentally, though
                 in this respect, phasic cells have no apparent advantage over
                 non-phasic cells. Another challenge for the cells is
                 maintaining this linear response during chronic stimulation,
                 and we show that the activity-dependent fatigue mechanism has
                 a potentially useful function in helping to maintain secretion
                 despite depletion of stores. Without this mechanism, secretion
                 in response to a steady stimulus declines as the stored

              nanoparticle coatings. This paper explores a Lattice Gas Model of
              the drying-mediated self-assembly of nanoparticle mixtures. The

                 area, cortical layer, cell type, and developmental stage.
                 Since short-term plasticity (STP) strongly shapes neural
                 dynamics, this diversity suggests a specific and essential
                 role in neural information processing. Therefore, a correct
                 characterization of short-term synaptic plasticity is an
                 important step towards understanding and modeling neural
                 systems. Phenomenological models have been developed, but they
                 are usually fitted to experimental data using
                 least-mean-square methods. We demonstrate that for typical
                 synaptic dynamics such fitting may give unreliable results. As
                 a solution, we introduce a Bayesian formulation, which yields
                 the posterior distribution over the model parameters given the
                 data. First, we show that common STP protocols yield broad
                 distributions over some model parameters. Using our result we
                 propose a experimental protocol to more accurately determine
                 synaptic dynamics parameters. Next, we infer the model
                 parameters using experimental data from three different
                 neocortical excitatory connection types. This reveals
                 connection-specific distributions, which we use to classify
                 synaptic dynamics. Our approach to demarcate
                 connection-specific synaptic dynamics is an important

                 plasticity, their function is not well understood and their
                 expression patterns are debated. We demonstrate that, in layer

                 control synaptic transmission at pyramidal cell inputs to

  abstract    = "The concept of the brain as a critical dynamical system is
                 very attractive because systems close to criticality are
                 thought to maximize their dynamic range of information
                 processing and communication. To date, there have been two key
                 experimental observations in support of this hypothesis: (i)
                 neuronal avalanches with power law distribution of size and
                 (ii) long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in the amplitude
                 of neural oscillations. The case for how these maximize
                 dynamic range of information processing and communication is
                 still being made and because a significant substrate for
                 information coding and transmission is neural synchrony it is
                 of interest to link synchronization measures with those of
                 criticality. We propose a framework for characterizing
                 criticality in synchronization based on an analysis of the
                 moment-to-moment fluctuations of phase synchrony in terms of
                 the presence of LRTCs. This framework relies on an estimation
                 of the rate of change of phase difference and a set of methods
                 we have developed to detect LRTCs. We test this framework
                 against two classical models of criticality (Ising and
                 Kuramoto) and recently described variants of these models
                 aimed to more closely represent human brain dynamics. From
                 these simulations we determine the parameters at which these
                 systems show evidence of LRTCs in phase synchronization. We
                 demonstrate proof of principle by analysing pairs of human
                 simultaneous EEG and EMG time series, suggesting that LRTCs of
                 corticomuscular phase synchronization can be detected in the
                 resting state and experimentally manipulated. The existence of
                 LRTCs in fluctuations of phase synchronization suggests that
                 these fluctuations are governed by non-local behavior, with
                 all scales contributing to system behavior. This has important
                 implications regarding the conditions under which one should
                 expect to see LRTCs in phase synchronization. Specifically,
                 brain resting states may exhibit LRTCs reflecting a state of
                 readiness facilitating rapid task-dependent shifts toward and
                 away from synchronous states that abolish LRTCs.",

                 neural network that, by construction, operates at a critical
                 point. This model allows us to consider various markers of
                 criticality and illustrate how they should perform in a
                 finite-size system. By calculating the exact distribution of
                 avalanche sizes, we are able to show that, over a limited
                 range of avalanche sizes which we precisely identify, the
                 distribution has scale free properties but is not a power law.
                 This suggests that it would be inappropriate to dismiss a
                 system as not being critical purely based on an inability to
                 rigorously fit a power law distribution as has been recently
                 advocated. In assessing whether a system, especially a
                 finite-size one, is critical it is thus important to consider
                 other possible markers. We illustrate one of these by showing
                 the divergence of susceptibility as the critical point of the
                 system is approached. Finally, we provide evidence that power
                 laws may underlie other observables of the system that may be

  abstract    = "Many neural circuits are capable of generating multiple
                 stereotyped outputs after different sensory inputs or
                 neuromodulation. We have previously identified the central
                 pattern generator (CPG) for Xenopus tadpole swimming that
                 involves antiphase oscillations of activity between the left
                 and right sides. Here we analyze the cellular basis for
                 spontaneous left-right motor synchrony characterized by
                 simultaneous bursting on both sides at twice the swimming
                 frequency. Spontaneous synchrony bouts are rare in most
                 tadpoles, and they instantly emerge from and switch back to
                 swimming, most frequently within the first second after skin
                 stimulation. Analyses show that only neurons that are active
                 during swimming fire action potentials in synchrony,
                 suggesting both output patterns derive from the same neural
                 circuit. The firing of excitatory descending interneurons
                 (dINs) leads that of other types of neurons in synchrony as it
                 does in swimming. During synchrony, the time window between
                 phasic excitation and inhibition is 7.9 ± 1 ms, shorter than
                 that in swimming (41 ± 2.3 ms). The occasional, extra midcycle
                 firing of dINs during swimming may initiate synchrony, and
                 mismatches of timing in the left and right activity can switch
                 synchrony back to swimming. Computer modeling supports these
                 findings by showing that the same neural network, in which
                 reciprocal inhibition mediates rebound firing, can generate
                 both swimming and synchrony without circuit reconfiguration.
                 Modeling also shows that lengthening the time window between
                 phasic excitation and inhibition by increasing dIN
                 synaptic/conduction delay can improve the stability of
                 synchrony.",

                 Consequently, this slows the optimization of present-day DBS
                 therapy and hinders its future development and application. We
                 used a computational model to calculate the distribution of
                 electric potential induced by DBS and study the effect of
                 stimulation on the spiking activity of a subthalamic nucleus
                 (STN) projection neuron. We previously showed that such a
                 model can reveal detailed spatial effects of stimulation in
                 the vicinity of the electrode. However, this

                 Such reductionist approaches, however, struggle to capture the
                 full scope of functional properties associated with even
                 ``simple'' brain nuclei. Using population functional calcium
                 imaging, we aim to describe how local circuits within the
                 zebrafish optic tectum process visual information.
                 Specifically, how are previously identified
                 direction-selective (DS) and orientation-selective (OS)
                 retinal ganglion cell (RGC) inputs (Nikolaou et al., 2012)
                 represented in tectal cells? First, we identify an emergent
                 population of DS tectal cell with a direction preference not
                 explicitly present in any one of the RGC inputs. Second, this
                 is associated with a striking shift from a tiled and
                 triangular representation of directional space (RGC inputs)
                 into an overlapping cardinal representation by tectal cell
                 populations. Third, and in contrast, we find that orientation
                 space is represented similarly in both the RGC input and
                 tectal cell populations illustrating feature-dependent
                 differences in how tectal circuits process their inputs.
                 Finally, we identify OS and two populations of DS cells at the
                 superficial border of the tectal neuropil, one of which is an
                 emergent population. This study, together with our previous
                 one (Nikolaou et al., 2012), demonstrate that

                 three functional classes of retinal inputs to the zebrafish
                 optic tectum during development. Our systems-based approach
                 was to analyze data from populations of retinal ganglion cells
                 labeled with a presynaptic targeted calcium indicator,
                 synaptophysin GCaMP3 (SyGCaMP3). Collectively, our findings
                 provide an insight as to the degree of visual encoding during
                 retino-tectal development and how it dynamically evolves from
                 a nascent and noisy presynaptic neural-scape to an
                 increasingly complex and refined representation. We report
                 five key features: (1) direction-selective inputs are
                 developmentally invariant; (2) orientation-selective inputs
                 exhibit highly dynamic properties over the same period, with
                 changes in their functional characteristics and spatial
                 organization; (3) inputs defined as anisotropic are an early
                 dominant functional class, with heterogeneous response
                 profiles, which progressively diminish in incidence and
                 spatial extent; (4) dark rearing selectively affects the
                 orientation-selective responses: both functional
                 characteristics and relative spatial distributions; and (5)
                 orientation-selective inputs exhibit four subtypes, two more
                 than previously identified in any species. Our approach was to
                 label RGC axon terminals with an indicator of activity and
                 quantitatively characterize coherent response properties to
                 different visual stimuli. Its application in the zebrafish,
                 given its small size and the accessibility of the tectum, has

              processing in many neural systems. Many measures have been
              proposed to summarize these correlations and of these the
              correlation index is widely used and is the standard in studies
              of spontaneous retinal activity. We show that this measure has
              two undesirable properties: it is unbounded above and confounded
              by firing rate. We list properties needed for a measure to fairly
              quantify and compare correlations and we propose a novel measure
              of correlation-the spike time tiling coefficient. This
              coefficient, the correlation index, and 33 other measures of
              correlation of spike times are blindly tested for the required
              properties on synthetic and experimental data. Based on this, we
              propose a measure (the spike time tiling coefficient) to replace
              the correlation index. To demonstrate the benefits of this
              measure, we reanalyze data from seven key studies, which
              previously used the correlation index to investigate the nature
              of spontaneous activity. We reanalyze data from $\beta$2(KO) and
              $\beta$2(TG) mutants, mutants lacking connexin isoforms, and also
              the age-dependent changes in wild-type and $\beta$2(KO)
              correlations. Reanalysis of the data using the proposed measure
              can significantly change the conclusions. It leads to better

              from the data. We hope that the proposed measure will have wide

                 represented by a network, ranges across various scales from
                 synaptic connections between individual neurons to fibre tract
                 connections between brain regions. Although the modularity
                 they commonly show has been extensively studied, it is unclear
                 whether the connection specificity of such networks can
                 already be fully explained by the modularity alone. To answer
                 this question, we study two networks, the neuronal network of
                 Caenorhabditis elegans and the fibre tract network of human
                 brains obtained through diffusion spectrum imaging. We compare
                 them to their respective benchmark networks with varying
                 modularities, which are generated by link swapping to have
                 desired modularity values. We find several network properties
                 that are specific to the neural networks and cannot be fully
                 explained by the modularity alone. First, the clustering
                 coefficient and the characteristic path length of both C.
                 elegans and human connectomes are higher than those of the
                 benchmark networks with similar modularity. High clustering
                 coefficient indicates efficient local information
                 distribution, and high characteristic path length suggests
                 reduced global integration. Second, the total wiring length is
                 smaller than for the alternative configurations with similar
                 modularity. This is due to lower dispersion of connections,
                 which means each neuron in the C. elegans connectome or each
                 region of interest in the human connectome reaches fewer
                 ganglia or cortical areas, respectively. Third, both neural
                 networks show lower algorithmic entropy compared with the
                 alternative arrangements. This implies that fewer genes are
                 needed to encode for the organization of neural systems. While
                 the first two findings show that the neural topologies are
                 efficient in information processing, this suggests that they
                 are also efficient from a developmental point of view.
                 Together, these results show that neural systems are organized
                 in such a way as to yield efficient features beyond those
                 given by their modularity alone.",

                 dendritic morphologies: an algorithm that generates all
                 possible dendritic trees with 22 terminal points, and one that
                 creates representative samples of trees with 128 terminal
                 points. Based on these trees, we construct multi-compartmental

                 models, we quantify their ability to discriminate learnt and

                 well-known example is the oculomotor integrator, which
                 anticipates the position-dependent elasticity forces acting on
                 the eye ball by mathematically integrating over time
                 oculomotor velocity commands. Many models of neural
                 integration have been proposed, based on feedback excitation,

                 report here that a computational model of the cerebellar
                 cortex, a structure thought to implement dynamic models,
                 reveals a hitherto unrecognized integrator circuit. In this
                 model, comprising Purkinje cells, molecular layer interneurons
                 and parallel fibres, Purkinje cells were able to generate
                 responses lasting more than 10 s, to which both neuronal and
                 network mechanisms contributed. Activation of the somatic fast
                 sodium current by subthreshold voltage fluctuations was able
                 to maintain pulse-evoked graded persistent activity, whereas
                 lateral inhibition among Purkinje cells via recurrent axon
                 collaterals further prolonged the responses to step and sine
                 wave stimulation. The responses of Purkinje cells decayed with
                 a time-constant whose value depended on their baseline spike
                 rate, with integration vanishing at low ( 30 per s). The model
                 predicts that the apparently fast circuit of the cerebellar
                 cortex may control the timing of slow processes without having
                 to rely on sensory feedback. Thus, the cerebellar cortex may
                 contain an adaptive temporal integrator, with the sensitivity

                 characteristics have been proposed to underlie this

                 vulnerable in PD will have a higher energy cost than those
                 that are less vulnerable. We show here, through the use of a
                 biology-based computational model of the axons of individual
                 dopamine neurons, that the energy cost of axon potential
                 propagation and recovery of the membrane potential increases
                 with the size and complexity of the axonal arbor according to
                 a power law. Thus SNc dopamine neurons, particularly in
                 humans, whose axons we estimate to give rise to more than 1
                 million synapses and have a total length exceeding 4 m, are at
                 a distinct disadvantage with respect to energy balance which
                 may be a factor in their selective vulnerability in PD.",

                 selectively to particular stimuli has not been directly
                 tested. We characterised a pair of neurons in locust larvae
                 that have been extensively studied in adults, where they are
                 known to respond selectively to objects approaching on a
                 collision course: the lobula giant motion detector (LGMD) and
                 its postsynaptic partner, the descending contralateral motion
                 detector (DCMD). Our physiological recordings of DCMD axon
                 spikes reveal that at the time of hatching, the neurons
                 already respond selectively to objects approaching the locust
                 and they discriminate between stimulus approach speeds with
                 differences in spike frequency. For a particular approaching
                 stimulus, both the number and peak frequency of spikes
                 increase with instar. In contrast, the number of spikes in
                 responses to receding stimuli decreases with instar, so
                 performance in discriminating approaching from receding
                 stimuli improves as the locust goes through successive moults.
                 In all instars, visual movement over one part of the visual
                 field suppresses a response to movement over another part.
                 Electron microscopy demonstrates that the anatomical substrate
                 for the selective response to approaching stimuli is present
                 in all larval instars: small neuronal processes carrying
                 information from the eye make synapses both onto LGMD
                 dendrites and with each other, providing pathways for lateral
                 inhibition that shape selectivity for approaching objects.",

                 crucial at any stage of their lives. For example, human babies
                 of only 6 days old display evasive responses to looming
                 stimuli (Bower et al. [1971]: Percept Psychophys 9: 193-196).
                 This means the neuronal pathways involved in looming detection
                 should mature early in life. Locusts have been used
                 extensively to examine the neural circuits and mechanisms
                 involved in sensing looming stimuli and triggering visually
                 evoked evasive actions, making them ideal subjects in which to
                 investigate the development of looming sensitivity. Two lobula
                 giant movement detectors (LGMD) neurons have been identified
                 in the lobula region of the locust visual system: the LGMD1
                 neuron responds selectively to looming stimuli and provides
                 information that contributes to evasive responses such as
                 jumping and emergency glides. The LGMD2 responds to looming
                 stimuli and shares many response properties with the LGMD1.
                 Both neurons have only been described in the adult. In this
                 study, we describe a practical method combining classical
                 staining techniques and 3D neuronal reconstructions that can
                 be used, even in small insects, to reveal detailed anatomy of
                 individual neurons. We have used it to analyze the anatomy of

                 important role in regulating sleep, as well as in anxiety and
                 depression, for which the serotonergic (5-HT) system is also
                 involved in. However, little is known regarding the direct and
                 indirect interactions between 5-HT in the dorsal raphe nucleus
                 (DRN) and Ox neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LHA). In
                 this study, we report the additional presence of 5-HT1BR,
                 5-HT2AR, 5-HT2CR and fast ligand-gated 5-HT3AR subtypes on the
                 Ox neurons of transgenic Ox-enhanced green fluorescent protein
                 (Ox-EGFP) and wild type C57Bl/6 mice using single and double
                 immunofluorescence (IF) staining, respectively, and quantify
                 the colocalization for each 5-HT receptor subtype. We further
                 reveal the presence of 5-HT3AR and 5-HT1AR on GABAergic
                 neurons in LHA. We also identify NMDAR1, OX1R and OX2R on Ox
                 neurons, but none on adjacent GABAergic neurons. This suggests
                 a one-way relationship between LHA's GABAergic and Ox neurons,
                 wherein GABAergic neurons exerts an inhibitory effect on Ox
                 neurons under partial DRN's 5-HT control. We also show that Ox
                 axonal projections receive glutamatergic (PSD-95
                 immunopositive) and GABAergic (Gephyrin immunopositive) inputs
                 in the DRN. We consider these and other available findings
                 into our computational model to explore possible effects of
                 neural circuit connection types and timescales on the DRN-LHA
                 system's dynamics. We find that if the connections from 5-HT
                 to LHA's GABAergic neurons are weakly excitatory or
                 inhibitory, the network exhibits slow oscillations; not
                 observed when the connection is strongly excitatory.
                 Furthermore, if Ox directly excites 5-HT neurons at a fast
                 timescale, phasic Ox activation can lead to an increase in
                 5-HT activity; no significant effect with slower timescale.
                 Overall, our experimental and computational approaches provide
                 insights towards a more complete understanding of the complex
                 relationship between 5-HT in the DRN and Ox in the LHA.",

                 variances/covariances with the ``so-called'' Sandwich

                 adjust neuronal activity on the basis of recent stimulus
                 history. In primary visual cortex (V1) in particular,
                 adaptation controls the responsiveness of individual neurons
                 and shifts their visual selectivity. What benefits does
                 adaptation confer on a neuronal population? We measured
                 adaptation in the responses of populations of cat V1 neurons
                 to stimulus ensembles with markedly different statistics of
                 stimulus orientation. We found that adaptation served two
                 homeostatic goals. First, it maintained equality in the
                 time-averaged responses across the population. Second, it
                 maintained independence in selectivity across the population.
                 Adaptation scaled and distorted population activity according
                 to a simple multiplicative rule that depended on neuronal
                 orientation preference and on stimulus orientation. We
                 conclude that adaptation in V1 acts as a mechanism of
                 homeostasis, enforcing a tendency toward equality and
                 independence in neural activity across the population.",

                 Nearly half of the V1 neurons were reliably driven by
                 combinations of visual speed and run speed. These neurons

                 discovered that a salient collinear column can impair local
                 visual search. The display used in that study had 21 rows and
                 27 columns of bars, all uniformly horizontal (or vertical)
                 except for one column of bars orthogonally oriented to all
                 other bars, making this unique column of collinear (or
                 noncollinear) bars salient in the display. Observers
                 discriminated an oblique target bar superimposed on one of the
                 bars either in the salient column or in the background.
                 Interestingly, responses were slower for a target in a salient

                 theoretical question of how contour integration interacts with

                 examination of how salience modulated the search impairment

                 features. It remains unclear whether PPC is implicated in
                 top-down and/or bottom-up components of attention. We aim to
                 clarify this by comparing performance of seven PPC patients
                 and healthy controls (HC) in a visual search task involving a
                 conflict between top-down and bottom-up processes. This task
                 requires essentially a bottom-up feature search. However,
                 top-down attention triggers feature binding for object
                 recognition, designed to be irrelevant but interfering to the
                 task. This results in top-down interference, prolonging the
                 search reaction time. This interference was indeed found in
                 our HCs but not in our PPC patients. In contrast to HC, the
                 PPC patients showed no evidence of prolonged reactions times,
                 even though they were slower than the HCs in search tasks
                 without the conflict. This finding is an example of
                 paradoxical functional facilitation (PFF) by brain damage. The
                 PFF effect enhanced our patients' performance by reducing the
                 top down interference. Our finding supports the idea that
                 right PPC plays a crucial role in top-down attentional
                 processes. In our search tasks, right PPC induces top-down
                 interference either by directing spatial attention to achieve

                 electrophysiological data is a key issue in neuroscience that
                 is central to understanding neuronal function and network
                 behavior. However, directly fitting detailed Hodgkin-Huxley
                 type model neurons to somatic membrane potential data is a
                 notoriously difficult optimization problem that can require
                 hours/days of supercomputing time. Here we extend an efficient
                 technique that indirectly matches neuronal currents derived
                 from somatic membrane potential data to two-compartment model
                 neurons with passive dendrites. In consequence, this approach
                 can fit semi-realistic detailed model neurons in a few
                 minutes. For validation, fits are obtained to model-derived
                 data for various thalamo-cortical neuron types, including
                 fast/regular spiking and bursting neurons. A key aspect of the
                 validation is sensitivity testing to perturbations arising in
                 experimental data, including sampling rates, inadequately
                 estimated membrane dynamics/channel kinetics and intrinsic
                 noise. We find that maximal conductance estimates and the
                 resulting membrane potential fits diverge smoothly and
                 monotonically from near-perfect matches when unperturbed.
                 Curiously, some perturbations have little effect on the error
                 because they are compensated by the fitted maximal
                 conductances. Therefore, the extended current-based technique
                 applies well under moderately inaccurate model assumptions, as
                 required for application to experimental data. Furthermore,
                 the accompanying perturbation analysis gives insights into
                 neuronal homeostasis, whereby tuning intrinsic neuronal

                 probabilistic formation of synaptic connections, we

                 When the resulting ``network'' is populated by model neurons

                 The now classic ``rubber hand illusion'' demonstrates that the
                 experience of body-ownership can be modulated by manipulating
                 the timing of exteroceptive (visual and tactile) body-related
                 feedback. Moreover, the strength of this modulation is related
                 to individual differences in sensitivity to internal bodily
                 signals (interoception). However the interaction of
                 exteroceptive and interoceptive signals in determining the
                 experience of body-ownership within an individual remains
                 poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that this depends on
                 the online integration of exteroceptive and interoceptive
                 signals by implementing an innovative ``cardiac rubber hand
                 illusion'' that combined computer-generated augmented-reality
                 with feedback of interoceptive (cardiac) information. We show
                 that both subjective and objective measures of virtual-hand
                 ownership are enhanced by cardio-visual feedback in-time with
                 the actual heartbeat, as compared to asynchronous feedback. We
                 further show that these measures correlate with individual
                 differences in interoceptive sensitivity, and are also

                 We found that stochastic opening of P/Q-, N- and R-type VGCCs
                 accounts for ∼50\% of all spontaneous glutamate release at rat

                 far greater role in spontaneous than in action
                 potential-evoked exocytosis. VGCC-dependent miniature
                 neurotransmitter release (minis) showed similar sensitivity to
                 presynaptic Ca2+ chelation as evoked release, arguing for
                 direct triggering of spontaneous release by transient
                 spatially localized Ca(2+) domains. Experimentally constrained
                 three-dimensional diffusion modeling of Ca2+ influx-exocytosis
                 coupling was consistent with clustered distribution of VGCCs

                 that spontaneous VGCCs openings can account for the

                 channel openings triggered release with low probability.
                 Uncorrelated stochastic VGCC opening is therefore a major

                 also receive their strongest input from LIV, but in addition,
                 a very strong and dense excitatory input from LVa. They
                 project extensively to LII/III as well as LVa and Vb of their

                 affects information transmission and processing. Simplified

                 protective/detrimental in in vitro models of excitotoxicty.
                 Kainate (KA)-induced neuronal death was significantly reduced
                 following exposure to mixed lymphocytes or purified T
                 lymphocytes containing either activated or non-activated
                 T-lymphocytes. Conditioned media from lymphocyte preparations,
                 but not boiled conditioned media, was protective against
                 KA-induced toxicity indicating soluble mediators underlie the
                 observed neuroprotection with cytokine arrays indicating IL-16
                 as the likely candidate. A role for astrocytes was established
                 as the neuroprotection was abolished in the presence of the
                 glial toxin, fluoroacetate. Furthermore, lymphocytes inhibited
                 p38 MAPK and ERK signalling pathways with pharmacological
                 inhibition of these pathways mimicking the protective effect

                 We report here findings that extend existing knowledge and
                 show that a modified reinforcement learning model, which has
                 separate parameters according to whether the previous trial
                 gave a reward or a punishment, can provide the best fit to
                 human behavior in decision making under uncertainty. More
                 specifically, we examined the fit of our modified
                 reinforcement learning model to human behavioral data in a
                 probabilistic two-alternative decision making task with rule
                 reversals. Our results demonstrate that this model predicted

                 activity. However, little is known about how such 'background'
                 synaptic input interacts with nonlinear dendritic mechanisms.
                 We have modified an existing model of a layer 5 (L5) pyramidal
                 cell to explore how dendritic integration in the apical
                 dendritic tuft could be altered by the levels of network
                 activity observed in vivo. Here we show that asynchronous
                 background excitatory input increases neuronal gain and
                 extends both temporal and spatial integration of
                 stimulus-evoked synaptic input onto the dendritic tuft.
                 Addition of fast and slow inhibitory synaptic conductances,
                 with properties similar to those from dendritic targeting
                 interneurons, that provided a 'balanced' background
                 configuration, partially counteracted these effects,
                 suggesting that inhibition can tune spatio-temporal
                 integration in the tuft. Excitatory background input lowered
                 the threshold for NMDA receptor-mediated dendritic spikes,
                 extended their duration and increased the probability of
                 additional regenerative events occurring in neighbouring
                 branches. These effects were also observed in a passive model
                 where all the non-synaptic voltage-gated conductances were
                 removed. Our results show that glutamate-bound NMDA receptors
                 arising from ongoing network activity can provide a powerful
                 spatially distributed nonlinear dendritic conductance. This
                 may enable L5 pyramidal cells to change their integrative
                 properties as a function of local network activity,

              mammalian cochlea. The filter consists of three specialized
              sub-filter stages which respectively provide passive response in
              low frequencies, actively tunable response in mid-band
              frequencies and ultra-steep roll-off at transition frequencies
              from pass-band to stop-band. The sub-filters are implemented in
              balanced ladder topology using floating active inductors.
              Measured results from the fabricated chip show that wide range of
              mid-band tuning including gain tuning of over 20dB, Q factor
              tuning from 2 to 19 as well as the bio-realistic center frequency

              configured to operate with center frequencies from 31 Hz to 8

                 cortical connectivity have been discovered: small-world
                 structure, pronounced hierarchical and modular organisation,
                 and strong core and rich-club structures. A common assumption
                 when interpreting results of this kind is that the observed
                 structural properties are present to enable the brain's
                 function. However, the brain is also embedded into the limited
                 space of the skull and its wiring has associated developmental
                 and metabolic costs. These basic physical and economic aspects
                 place separate, often conflicting, constraints on the brain's
                 connectivity, which must be characterized in order to
                 understand the true relationship between brain structure and
                 function. To address this challenge, here we ask which, and to
                 what extent, aspects of the structural organisation of the
                 brain are conserved if we preserve specific spatial and
                 topological properties of the brain but otherwise randomise
                 its connectivity. We perform a comparative analysis of a
                 connectivity map of the cortical connectome both on high- and
                 low-resolutions utilising three different types of surrogate
                 networks: spatially unconstrained ('random'), connection
                 length preserving ('spatial'), and connection length optimised
                 ('reduced') surrogates. We find that unconstrained
                 randomisation markedly diminishes all investigated
                 architectural properties of cortical connectivity. By
                 contrast, spatial and reduced surrogates largely preserve most
                 properties and, interestingly, often more so in the reduced
                 surrogates. Specifically, our results suggest that the
                 cortical network is less tightly integrated than its spatial
                 constraints would allow, but more strongly segregated than its
                 spatial constraints would necessitate. We additionally find
                 that hierarchical organisation and rich-club structure of the
                 cortical connectivity are largely preserved in spatial and
                 reduced surrogates and hence may be partially attributable to
                 cortical wiring constraints. In contrast, the high modularity
                 and strong s-core of the high-resolution cortical network are
                 significantly stronger than in the surrogates, underlining
                 their potential functional relevance in the brain.",

                 sources in multi-odour backgrounds. Recent behavioural
                 experiments show that this ability relies on detecting
                 millisecond stimulus asynchronies between odourants that
                 originate from different sources. Honeybees, Apis mellifera,
                 are able to distinguish mixtures where both odourants arrive
                 at the same time (synchronous mixtures) from those where
                 odourant onsets are staggered (asynchronous mixtures) down to
                 an onset delay of only 6ms. In this paper we explore this
                 surprising ability in a model of the insects' primary
                 olfactory brain area, the antennal lobe. We hypothesize that a
                 winner-take-all inhibitory network of local neurons in the
                 antennal lobe has a symmetry-breaking effect, such that the
                 response pattern in projection neurons to an asynchronous
                 mixture is different from the response pattern to the
                 corresponding synchronous mixture for an extended period of
                 time beyond the initial odourant onset where the two mixture
                 conditions actually differ. The prolonged difference between
                 response patterns to synchronous and asynchronous mixtures
                 could facilitate odoursegregation in downstream circuits of
                 the olfactory pathway. We present a detailed data-driven model

                 afferents to filtered, white noise whisker motion in

                 activity that sweep across the ganglion cell layer during a
                 limited period of development before the onset of visual
                 experience. The spatiotemporal patterns encoded in the waves
                 are believed to be instructive for the wiring of functional
                 connections throughout the visual system. However, the
                 ontogeny of retinal waves is still poorly documented as a
                 result of the relatively low resolution of conventional
                 recording techniques. Here, we characterize the spatiotemporal
                 features of mouse retinal waves from birth until eye opening
                 in unprecedented detail using a large-scale, dense,
                 4096-channel multielectrode array that allowed us to record
                 from the entire neonatal retina at near cellular resolution.
                 We found that early cholinergic waves propagate with random
                 trajectories over large areas with low ganglion cell
                 recruitment. They become slower, smaller and denser when GABAA
                 signalling matures, as occurs beyond postnatal day (P) 7.
                 Glutamatergic influences dominate from P10, coinciding with
                 profound changes in activity dynamics. At this time, waves
                 cease to be random and begin to show repetitive trajectories
                 confined to a few localized hotspots. These hotspots gradually
                 tile the retina with time, and disappear after eye opening.
                 Our observations demonstrate that retinal waves undergo major
                 spatiotemporal changes during ontogeny. Our results support
                 the hypotheses that cholinergic waves guide the refinement of
                 retinal targets and that glutamatergic waves may also support
                 the wiring of retinal receptive fields.",

  abstract    = "Ketamine and propofol are two well-known, powerful anesthetic
                 agents, yet at first sight this appears to be their only
                 commonality. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic agent,
                 whose main mechanism of action is considered to be
                 N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism; whereas propofol is a
                 general anesthetic agent, which is assumed to primarily
                 potentiate currents gated by γ-aminobutyric acid type A
                 (GABAA) receptors. However, several experimental observations
                 suggest a closer relationship. First, the effect of ketamine
                 on the electroencephalogram (EEG) is markedly changed in the
                 presence of propofol: on its own ketamine increases θ (4-8 Hz)
                 and decreases α (8-13 Hz) oscillations, whereas ketamine
                 induces a significant shift to beta band frequencies (13-30
                 Hz) in the presence of propofol. Second, both ketamine and
                 propofol cause inhibition of the inward pacemaker current I h,
                 by binding to the corresponding hyperpolarization-activated
                 cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 1 (HCN1) subunit.
                 The resulting effect is a hyperpolarization of the neuron's
                 resting membrane potential. Third, the ability of both
                 ketamine and propofol to induce hypnosis is reduced in
                 HCN1-knockout mice. Here we show that one can theoretically
                 understand the observed spectral changes of the EEG based on
                 HCN1-mediated hyperpolarizations alone, without involving the
                 supposed main mechanisms of action of these drugs through NMDA
                 and GABAA, respectively. On the basis of our successful EEG
                 model we conclude that ketamine and propofol should be
                 antagonistic to each other in their interaction at HCN1
                 subunits. Such a prediction is in accord with the results of
                 clinical experiment in which it is found that ketamine and
                 propofol interact in an infra-additive manner with respect to
                 the endpoints of hypnosis and immobility.",

                 cell to demonstrate that spine head calcium provides an
                 instantaneous readout at each synapse of the postsynaptic
                 weighted sum of all presynaptic activity impinging on the
                 cell. The form of the readout is equivalent to the functions
                 of weighted, summed inputs used in neural network learning
                 rules. Within a dendritic layer, peak spine head calcium
                 levels are either a linear or sigmoidal function of the number
                 of coactive synapses, with nonlinearity depending on the
                 ability of voltage spread in the dendrites to reach calcium
                 spike threshold. This is strongly controlled by the potassium
                 A-type current, with calcium spikes and the consequent
                 sigmoidal increase in peak spine head calcium present only
                 when the A-channel density is low. Other membrane
                 characteristics influence the gain of the relationship between
                 peak calcium and the number of active synapses. In particular,
                 increasing spine neck resistance increases the gain due to
                 increased voltage responses to synaptic input in spine heads.
                 Colocation of stimulated synapses on a single dendritic branch
                 also increases the gain of the response. Input pathways
                 cooperate: CA3 inputs to the proximal apical dendrites can
                 strongly amplify peak calcium levels due to weak EC input to
                 the distal dendrites, but not so strongly vice versa. CA3
                 inputs to the basal dendrites can boost calcium levels in the
                 proximal apical dendrites, but the relative electrical
                 compactness of the basal dendrites results in the reverse
                 effect being less significant. These results give pointers as
                 to how to better describe the contributions of pre- and
                 postsynaptic activity in the learning {"}rules{"} that apply
                 in these cells. The calcium signal is closer in form to the

                 points on the colliculus are represented in the visual field
                 in the correct relative order. In maps from animals with
                 knock-out of the three ephrinA ligands (TKO), thought to
                 specify the rostrocaudal axis of the map, the projection on
                 the colliculus of each small circular area of visual field is
                 elongated approximately rostrocaudally. Of these projections,
                 9\% are made up of two distinct regions lying along the
                 direction of ingrowth of retinal fibers. These are similar to
                 the ectopic projections found in other ephrinA knock-out data.
                 Coexisting with the ectopic projections, each TKO map contains
                 a submap where neighbor-neighbor relations are preserved,
                 which is ordered along both rostrocaudal and mediolateral
                 axes, in the orientation found in wild-type maps. The submaps

                 understanding of the visual system at many levels, from the
                 developmental to the computational. It is important to be able
                 to relate different coordinate systems, e.g. maps of the
                 visual field and maps of the retina. Retinal maps are
                 frequently based on flat-mount preparations. These use
                 dissection and relaxing cuts to render the quasi-spherical
                 retina into a 2D preparation. The variable nature of relaxing
                 cuts and associated tears limits quantitative cross-animal
                 comparisons. We present an algorithm, {"}Retistruct,{"} that
                 reconstructs retinal flat-mounts by mapping them into a
                 standard, spherical retinal space. This is achieved by:
                 stitching the marked-up cuts of the flat-mount outline;
                 dividing the stitched outline into a mesh whose vertices then
                 are mapped onto a curtailed sphere; and finally moving the
                 vertices so as to minimise a physically-inspired deformation
                 energy function. Our validation studies indicate that the
                 algorithm can estimate the position of a point on the intact
                 adult retina to within 8° of arc (3.6\% of nasotemporal axis).
                 The coordinates in reconstructed retinae can be transformed to
                 visuotopic coordinates. Retistruct is used to investigate the
                 organisation of the adult mouse visual system. We orient the
                 retina relative to the nictitating membrane and compare this
                 to eye muscle insertions. To align the retinotopic and
                 visuotopic coordinate systems in the mouse, we utilised the
                 geometry of binocular vision. In standard retinal space, the
                 composite decussation line for the uncrossed retinal
                 projection is located 64° away from the retinal pole.
                 Projecting anatomically defined uncrossed retinal projections
                 into visual space gives binocular congruence if the optical
                 axis of the mouse eye is oriented at 64° azimuth and 22°
